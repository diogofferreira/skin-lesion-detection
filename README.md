Over the last few years, Deep Learning has been on the spotlight when it comes
to solving many complex problems, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in
the field of image recognition.   

Since this Neural Networks can sometimes achieve more than 50 layers deep,
Transfer Learning (TL) techniques are also getting popular to retrain some of the
layers of Neural Networks that learned from a generic dataset, putting it to use in another case.  

In this work, we attempt using CNNs and TL tecnhiques on pre-trained Neural Networks
to distinguish melanoma skin cancer from seborrheic keratosis and nevus benign tumors.

The dataset was originally available as a challenge at [ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/n/ISIC_2017%3A_Skin_Lesion_Analysis_Towards_Melanoma_Detection).
